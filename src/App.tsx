          Bitcoin is famously volatile and trades 24/7, with occasional meteoric
          rises that have changed people's lives. That seems to causes vigilance
          that's the perfect storm for stress and anxiety. Rather than try to
          find investing alpha, I wanted to measure the <em>emotional</em>{' '}
          challenge of holding Bitcoin. I ended up looking mostly at a simple
          metric:{' '}
          <strong>
            what is the value of bitcoin as a percentage of the previous
            all-time high?

        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          I assumed that like me, most people anchor their mental value of
          Bitcoin to its high water mark, even if the asset was only valued at
          that number for days or even hours, and only a minimal amount of
          volume actually changed hands at that price.

        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          When the current value is close to the all-time high, it feels good!
          After all, you can sell your stash for roughly what you believe it to
          be worth. And why not hold on longer? Maybe you'll find out it's even
          worth more! Whereas when the current value is comparatively low, you
          feel bad because you could have sold it for more. Maybe you're the
          sucker. The lower it goes, the worse you feel.

          above its previous all-time high. These represent the most euphoric

      <Section title="The Emotional Journey Over Time">
        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          I wasn't around for those days, but when I graphed the PoPATH over
          time, I do believe it captures my emotional highs and lows for the
          parts of the journey I was on. You can see clusters at the top where
          it felt good to hold, extended dips where it felt bad, and some spiky
          periods which were probably the most distracting.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          It also captures that for me, the highs didn't actually feel better as
          it went up. They more or less felt the same. And once we'd hit a new
          high water mark, I pretty quickly got greedy about wanting to hit
          another one.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          Taking the broader view, it does appear that the drops are getting
          less extreme percentage-wise, and I think the emotional component
          scales with that. Afer all, the difference in experience between a 75%
          drop (Nov 2022) and a 93% drop (Nov 2011) is that a 93% drop is your
          investment dropping by 75%, then that remaining amount dropping by 75%
          again.

          Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          Hindsight is 20/20. We can look back and with the knowledge that the
          toughest days to hold Bitcoin were actually the best times to buy the
          dip, but in real time, that decision isn't easy. There were moments
          where it wasn't clear that Bitcoin would continue to exist at all, let
          alone return to its prior heights. The regret of not selling can be
          just as painful as the regret of not buying, and from that standpoint,
          despite being the best performing asset in history, most people in
          bitcoin are in this funny superposition of wishing they had gotten in
          earlier, while also feeling like they missed out on a great time to
          sell.

          Bitcoin is famously volatile and trades 24/7, with occasional meteoric
          rises that have changed people's lives. It's the perfect storm for
          stress and anxiety. I wanted to understand the <em>emotional</em>{' '}
          difficulty of holding Bitcoin, so I explored a simple metric:{' '}

          I assumed that like me, most people anchor their mental value of
          Bitcoin to the all-time high when thinking about their investment,
          even if the asset was only valued at that number for days or even
          hours, and only a minimal amount of volume actually changed hands.

        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          When the current value is close to the all-time high, you feel good!
          After all, you can sell your stash for roughly what you believe it to
          be worth. And why not hold on longer? Maybe you'll find out it's even
          worth more! Whereas when the current value is comparatively low, you
          feel bad because you could have sold it for more. The lower it goes,
          the worse you feel.

          In this chart of PoPATH over time, you can see clusters at the top
          where it felt good to hold, extended dips where it felt bad, and some
          spiky periods where it was an emotionally volatile rollercoaster. It
          does appear that the drops are getting less extreme percentage-wise.
          The difference in experience between a 75% drop (Nov 2022) and a 93%
          drop (Nov 2011) is that a 93% drop is your investment dropping by 75%,
          then that remaining amount dropping by 75% again.

          Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          Hindsight is 20/20. We can look back and with the knowledge that the
          toughest days to hold Bitcoin were actually the best times to buy the
          dip, but in real time, that decision isn't easy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-5 text-text-dark leading-relaxed">
          There were moments where it wasn't clear that Bitcoin would continue
          to exist at all, let alone return to its prior heights. The regret of
          not selling can be just as painful as the regret of not buying, and
          from that standpoint, despite being the best performing asset in
          history, most of the time Bitcoin holders are feeling like they missed
          out on a great time to sell.
